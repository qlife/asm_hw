This is homework code of the course ASM programming, 2006 Spring in CS.NCTU.EDU.TW.
I've already graduated and this course is no longer provided to students.

Actually CS.NCTU.EDU.TW adopted totally different course scheme and this course are give by
professor Li-Pin Chang, all the exercises are changed. So It is safe to release them out.

If you are looking for some x86 arch, real mode, 16 bits assembly programming techniques 
then I'll refer you for the following site (in Traditional Chinese):
